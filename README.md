<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A student from Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) undertook to build a mobile centered campus information prototype application in partnership with Valparaiso University’s College of Business (COB). This prototype effort would assist in navigation issues, event awareness, and providing easy access to commonly sought tools and platforms. The CIS student opted to build the prototype with the React Native multi-platform framework supporting multiple mobile ecosystems, because it is built on top of the widely used JavaScript language. The CIS team also created JSON-server artifacts as a substitute for a full database implementation for the prototype to allow for faster capability demonstration. These choices enabled the system to be built in an “agile driven” collaborative approach, while still incorporating ongoing input and feedback from the ongoing COB team’s polling and interview efforts. Within the prototype application, users are able to access DataVU, otherwise known as Colleague™, the primary integrated student information system. Also accessible to students is the BlackBoard™ portal, the central learning management system employed by the University. Extra features include a ‘panic button’ capability to contact campus police, counseling, and health centers, as well as taking users to an externally hosted, interactive campus map.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Usage

This prototype is used as a 'pocket knife' for the Valparaiso University community. It offers many different features requested by potential users which assist with many different aspects of life on campus. Using this application, users are able to:

- Register and manage a Valpo User account
- Access the Founder's Menu
- Contact various Campus Resources
- Call Valparaiso University's Police Department with a 'Panic Button'
- Access the ValpoNav Campus Navigation application

Using ValpoNav, another application, users find much more information about buildings on campus. ValpoNav allows users to find a desired building which enables them to view inside to find more details about the building, including but not limited to:

- An image of the building
- A brief description of the building
- A link to the floorplans for the building

See the [ValpoNav repository](https://github.com/charliemalach/ValpoNav) for a more indepth explanation of the application.
